# Mapfox
Mapfox is a team project during Haaga-Helia's software project II -course 2020. 

We were inspired by map interfaces and wanted to create our own map application, that could be used for actions like creating events, sharing event maps and participating events.

Mapfox is a map based mobile application project build with React Native and Node.js.
With the application you can:
* Fetch places from Helsinki API and include selected places to your event
* Save events
* Fetch a list of events
* Select event from a list and see the places included on a map

REST API provided by city of Helsinki is used in this project.
